Object Oriented Programming(OOP)
What are objects?

we can create objects using:
object literals
constructor function
syntactic suger, class

Encapsulation
Polymophysm
Encapsulation
Abstraction

Encapsulation is the process of storing 
functions(methods) with their associated 
data (properties) into an object.
Why is Encapsulation important?
--It help with organisation 
--It help to solve the problem of spaghetti codes
--Its easy to add new features and functionalities

(made it easier to add new stuff)
(made it easier to read through your code)
(made it so you are not afraid to make changes)


Abstraction
Hide details and show essentials
enables you to implement things without understanding or even thinking  of whats happening
it enables us to create things onces
(SIMPLE, PREDICTABLE AND MANAGEABLE)
(smaller more managerable pieces of code)
