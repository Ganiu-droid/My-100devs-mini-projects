Object Oriented Programming(OOP)
What are objects?

we can create objects using:
object literals
constructor function
syntactic suger, class
========================================
OOP is a Programming paradigm
Encapsulation
Polymophysm
Encapsulation
Abstraction
==================================
Encapsulation is the process of storing 
functions(methods) with their associated 
data (properties) into an object.
Why is Encapsulation important?
--It help with organisation 
--It help to solve the problem of spaghetti codes
--Its easy to add new features and functionalities

(made it easier to add new stuff)
(made it easier to read through your code)
(made it so you are not afraid to make changes)

=================================
Abstraction
Hide details and show essentials
enables you to implement things without understanding or even thinking  of whats happening
it enables us to create things onces
(SIMPLE, PREDICTABLE AND MANAGEABLE)
(smaller more managerable pieces of code)


===============================
Inheritance
make a class from another class for a hierachy 
of class that share a set of properties and methods

================================
using Getters and setters
to make some properties and method unchangeable from the outside


A hundred hour project: A fullstack project
MVP: MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT: A product that proves that your idea works. Then you can add up later

=======================
Sibling descendants of a base class will all 
have the dame interface but varying implementations


===========================
Polymorphism
code written uses an interface authomatically knows how to work with 
any number of different onjects that provide the interface
Provides a way to perform a single action in different forms
Help you avoid if/else and switch and case statement
